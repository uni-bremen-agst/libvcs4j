This package provides support for precondition checking and assertions.

<h3>Preconditions vs Assertions</h3>
<p>To understand the difference between preconditions and assertions it is
important do differentiate between the developer of a component (class,
method, ...) and the user of this component.</p>
<p><b>Preconditions</b> are used to signal violations of the usage
contract of components to its <em>user</em>. These preconditions are
usually documented as part of the component's comment. 
Examples: "Argument may not
be <code>null</code>", "Argument must be positive", 
"cannot call <code>x</code> for empty list". Preconditions are checked
using the methods of the {@link org.conqat.lib.commons.assertion.CCSMPre}
class. Violations are signaled with 
{@link org.conqat.lib.commons.assertion.PreconditionException}s.
</p>
<p><b>Assertions</b> are used to check that invariants that only the
developer of component knows are valid. These are used to check for
<em>implementation</em> (opposed to <em>usage</em>) faults.
Examples are: "Stack size 
cannot be negative.", "Array index must not be greater than array length".
Assertions are checked
using the methods of the {@link org.conqat.lib.commons.assertion.CCSMAssert}
class. Violations are signaled with 
{@link java.lang.AssertionError}s.
