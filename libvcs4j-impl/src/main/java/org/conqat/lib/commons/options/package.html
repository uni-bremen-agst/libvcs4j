Classes for simplifying command line parsing. The general idea is to annotate methods with 
{@link org.conqat.lib.commons.options.AOption}, which are then exposed as command line switches. Whether the 
option takes an argument (and the type of the argument) is determined by the arguments the method accepts.
Additional constraints on the option arguments (e.g. value positive) can be enforced by the method by throwing
an IllegalArgumentException.
</p>

<p>
The options are extracted and collected by an {@link org.conqat.lib.commons.options.OptionRegistry}. The 
OptionRegistry extracts methods annotated with AOption and keeps them as 
{@link org.conqat.lib.commons.options.OptionApplicator}s for later use. To support the distribution of option handling
over multiple classes (e.g. to separate options affecting different parts of the architecture) multiple objects
can be registered with the registry.
</p>

<p>
The actual parsing of the command line is performed by the {@link org.conqat.lib.commons.options.CommandLine}. This 
is to separate the low level part (annotations and reflection) from the parser. Additionally this way the parser
can easily be extended or exchanged.
</p>

<p>
As an example for using these classes see the org.conqat.engine.core.driver.Driver
class in the ConQAT project.
